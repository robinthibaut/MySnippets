    "\n",
    "Tuples are similar to lists, except that they are surrounded by parenthesis instead of brackets, and their data storage variety is also limited. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples values are unchangeable. They can, however, be removed or added to entirely- a new variant called concatenation is used to accomplish this, but it is much slower than standard appending operations offered by lists, so lists should be preferred over tuples unless there is a compelling reason not to! Tuples use less memory than lists and are useful in situations such as sequences with an undefined length (such as the contents of a file). Tuples, such as lists, have an index value of 0 and can be indexed in the same way that strings and lists can! You can use the multiple assignment technique if you assign a tuple to a variable! \n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple assignment denotes the ability to assign a single variable to more than one value! \n",
    "x, y = 1,2 is an example of this. In this case, x is set to 1 and y is set to 2. The comma serves as a connector for assigning multiple values with a single line of code. \n",

    "Sets are another type of data structure that you should be familiar with. Try making your own set and printing out all of its elements to get a sense of what it does. \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, sets behave similarly to an unordered list, but they cannot contain duplicate values! After creating your own set, use methods like print(yourSetVariableName) to print out its elements, and then go ahead and start looking up how to perform many different operations and methods with it, such as intersection, union, and so on, and try writing your own code using these! Remember that sets contain unique values, and values contained within them cannot be indexed; otherwise, we'd end up with duplicates! The sooner you learn about these built-in data structures, the sooner you'll be able to use them! Finally, keep in mind that when storing data, it is critical to not only store what you need, but also to store it correctly! Use lists or tuples when you know exactly what data you need but don't care about ordering; use sets when you care about having duplicate free collections but don't need indexing!"

    "Dictionary's are a unique type of data structure in that they do not use indices at all, instead relying on keys that are linked to values! \n",
    "Keys can be any type of immutable data, such as numbers or strings. Any data type, including lists and dictionaries, can be used as values! Dictionaries are called \"mappings\" because they \"map\" or \"associate\" keys to values! SomeDictionaryVariableName = key1: value1, key2: value2, etc. is the general syntax for creating dictionaries. By simply indexing dictionaries, we can obtain values! To index them, we use the form of someDictionaryVariableName[key] to assign our dictionary variable to a key, which returns the value associated with the key we supplied. If the key does not exist, a key error will be thrown! someDictionaryVariableName is used to see if a key exists in the dictionary. get(key) returns None if the key does not exist; otherwise, it returns the value! It is important to remember that while dictionaries always have unique keys, they can have duplicate values! Using get to access items is much faster than using [key]! Use get if you're trying to print out input that requires a key  but you're not sure if it's in your dictionary (we'll cover exceptions and error handling # soon!).
